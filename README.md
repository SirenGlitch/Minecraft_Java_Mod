# Minecraft Java Mod
This is my Minecraft mod, it is currently connected to my MCreator so any changes I make and push will be reflected here.
## Any feature requests can be set as an issue or discussion, pull requests are welcome, make sure you describe what you are adding and why it should be added.
This project is supposed to be a hobby thing as opposed to being a full on dedication, so updates will not be _that_ often **but** will still happen. If no updates have happened in a while, submit a feature request! They will only be dry if I am out of ideas. My [Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/My_Minecraft_Addon) is also a good place to post ideas.
